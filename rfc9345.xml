    <abstract>
      <t>The organizational separation between operators of TLS and DTLS
endpoints and the certification authority can create limitations.  For
example, the lifetime of certificates, how they may be used, and the
algorithms they support are ultimately determined by the
CA.  This document describes a mechanism to
to overcome some of these limitations by enabling operators to
delegate their own credentials for use in TLS and DTLS without breaking
compatibility with peers that do not support this specification.</t>

      <t>Server operators often deploy (D)TLS termination to act as the server for
inbound TLS connections.  These termination services can be in locations such
as remote data centers or Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) where it may
be difficult to detect compromises of private key material corresponding
to TLS certificates.  Short-lived certificates may be
used to limit the exposure of keys in these cases.</t>
      <t>However, short-lived certificates need to be renewed more frequently than
long-lived certificates.  If an external Certification Authority (CA) is unable to issue a certificate in
time to replace a deployed certificate, the server would no longer be able to
present a valid certificate to clients.  With short-lived certificates, there is
a smaller window of time to renew a certificate and therefore a higher risk that
an outage at a CA will negatively affect the uptime of the TLS-fronted service.</t>
      <t>Typically, a (D)TLS server uses a certificate provided by some entity other than
the operator of the server (a CA) <xref target="RFC8446"/>
        <xref target="RFC5280"/>.  This organizational separation makes the (D)TLS server operator
dependent on the CA for some aspects of its operations. For example:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>Whenever the server operator wants to deploy a new certificate, it has to
interact with the CA.</li>
        <li>The CA might only issue credentials containing certain types of public keys,
which can limit the set of (D)TLS signature schemes usable by the server
operator.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>To reduce the dependency on external CAs, this document specifies a limited delegation
mechanism that allows a (D)TLS peer to issue its own credentials within
the scope of a certificate issued by an external CA.  These credentials only enable the
recipient of the delegation to terminate connections for names that the CA has authorized.  Furthermore,
this mechanism allows the server to use modern signature algorithms such as
Ed25519 <xref target="RFC8032"/> even if their CA does not support them.</t>
      <t>This document refers to the certificate issued by the CA as a "certificate",
or "delegation certificate", and the one issued by the operator as a "delegated
credential" or "DC".</t>

      <name>Solution Overview</name>
      <t>A delegated credential (DC) is a digitally signed data structure with two semantic
fields: a validity interval and a public key (along with its associated
signature algorithm).  The signature on the delegated credential indicates a delegation
from the certificate that is issued to the peer.  The private key
used to sign a credential corresponds to the public key of the peer's
X.509 end-entity certificate <xref target="RFC5280"/>.</t>
      <t>A (D)TLS handshake that uses delegated credentials differs from a standard handshake
in a few important ways:</t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>The initiating peer provides an extension in its ClientHello or CertificateRequest
that indicates support for this mechanism.</li>
        <li>The peer sending the Certificate message provides both the certificate
chain terminating in its certificate and the delegated credential.</li>
        <li>The initiator uses information from the peer's certificate
to verify the delegated credential and that the peer is asserting an
expected identity, determining an authentication result for the peer.</li>
        <li>Peers accepting the delegated credential use it as the certificate
key for the (D)TLS handshake.</li>
      </ul>
      <t>As detailed in <xref target="delegated-credentials"/>, the delegated credential is
cryptographically bound to the end-entity certificate with which the
credential may be used.  This document specifies the use of delegated
credentials in (D)TLS 1.3 or later; their use in prior versions of the
protocol is not allowed.</t>
      <t>Delegated credentials allow a peer to terminate (D)TLS connections on behalf of
the certificate owner.  If a credential is stolen, there is no mechanism for
revoking it without revoking the certificate itself.  To limit exposure in case
of the compromise of a delegated credential's private key, delegated credentials
have a maximum validity period.  In the absence of an application profile standard
specifying otherwise, the maximum validity period is set to 7 days.  Peers <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> issue credentials with a validity period longer than the maximum validity period or that extends beyond the validity period of the delegation certificate.
This mechanism is described in detail in <xref target="client-and-server-behavior"/>.</t>
      <t>It was noted in <xref target="XPROT"/> that certificates in use by servers that
support outdated protocols such as SSLv2 can be used to forge
signatures for certificates that contain the keyEncipherment KeyUsage
(<xref section="4.2.1.3" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC5280"/>).  In order to reduce the risk of cross-
protocol attacks on certificates that are not intended to be used
with DC-capable TLS stacks, we define a new DelegationUsage
extension to X.509 that permits use of delegated credentials.  (See <xref target="certificate-requirements"/>.)</t>
      <section anchor="rationale">
        <name>Rationale</name>
        <t>Delegated credentials present a better alternative than other delegation
mechanisms like proxy certificates <xref target="RFC3820"/> for several reasons:</t>
        <ul spacing="normal">
          <li>There is no change needed to certificate validation at the PKI layer.</li>
          <li>X.509 semantics are very rich.  This can cause unintended
consequences if a service owner creates a proxy certificate where
the properties differ from the leaf certificate.  Proxy certificates can
be useful in controlled environments, but remain a risk in scenarios
where the additional flexibility they provide is not necessary.  For
this reason,  delegated credentials have very restricted semantics
that should not conflict with X.509 semantics.</li>
          <li>Proxy certificates rely on the certificate path building process to establish
a binding between the proxy certificate and the end-entity certificate.  Since
the certificate path building process is not cryptographically protected, it is
possible that a proxy certificate could be bound to another certificate with
the same public key, with different X.509 parameters.  Delegated credentials,
which rely on a cryptographic binding between the entire certificate and the
delegated credential, cannot.</li>
          <li>Each delegated credential is bound to a specific signature algorithm for use
in the (D)TLS handshake (<xref section="4.2.3" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC8446"/>).  This prevents
them from being used with other, perhaps unintended, signature algorithms.
The signature algorithm bound to the delegated credential can be chosen
independently of the set of signature algorithms supported by the end-entity
certificate.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section anchor="related-work">
        <name>Related Work</name>
        <t>Many of the use cases for delegated credentials can also be addressed using
purely server-side mechanisms that do not require changes to client behavior
(e.g., a PKCS#11 interface or a remote signing mechanism, <xref target="KEYLESS"/> being one
example).  These
mechanisms, however, incur per-transaction latency, since the front-end
server has to interact with a back-end server that holds a private key.  The
mechanism proposed in this document allows the delegation to be done
offline, with no per-transaction latency.  The figure below compares the
message flows for these two mechanisms
with (D)TLS 1.3 <xref target="RFC8446"/> <xref target="RFC9147"/>.</t>

]]></artwork>
        <t>These two mechanisms can be complementary.  A server could use
delegated credentials for clients that support them, while using a
server-side mechanism to support legacy clients.  Both mechanisms
require a trusted relationship between the front-end and back-end --
the delegated credential can be used in place of a certificate
private key.</t>
        <t>The use of short-lived certificates with automated certificate issuance,
e.g., with the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) <xref target="RFC8555"/>,
reduces the risk of key compromise but has several limitations.
Specifically, it introduces an operationally critical dependency on an
external party (the CA).  It also
limits the types of algorithms supported for (D)TLS authentication to those
the CA is willing to issue a certificate for.  Nonetheless, existing
automated issuance APIs like ACME may be useful for provisioning delegated credentials.</t>

      <t>While X.509 forbids end-entity certificates from being used as issuers for
other certificates, it is valid to use them to issue other signed
objects as long as the certificate contains the digitalSignature KeyUsage
(<xref section="4.2.1.3" sectionFormat="comma" target="RFC5280"/>).  (All certificates compatible with TLS 1.3 are
required to contain the digitalSignature KeyUsage.)  This document defines a new signed
object format that would encode only the semantics that are needed for this
application.  The Credential has the following structure:</t>
      <artwork><![CDATA[

        <dd>
          <t>Time, in seconds relative to the delegation certificate's
notBefore value, after which the delegated credential is no longer valid.
By default, unless set to an alternative value by an application profile (see
<xref target="solution-overview"/>), endpoints will reject delegated credentials that expire more than 7
days from the current time (as described in <xref target="validating-a-delegated-credential"/>).</t>

When
using RSA, the public key <bcp14>MUST NOT</bcp14> use the rsaEncryption OID.  As a result,

        <name>Client Clock Skew</name>
        <t>One of the risks of deploying a short-lived credential system based
on absolute time is client clock skew.  If a client's clock is sufficiently
ahead of or behind the server's clock, then clients will reject delegated credentials
that are valid from the server's perspective.  Clock
skew also affects the validity of the original certificates.  The lifetime
of the delegated credential should be set taking clock skew into account.
Clock skew may affect a delegated credential at the beginning and end of
its validity periods, which should also be taken into account.</t>

        <name>Security of Delegated Credential's Private Key</name>
        <t>Delegated credentials limit the exposure of the private key used in
a (D)TLS connection by limiting its validity period.  An attacker who
compromises the private key of a delegated credential
cannot create new delegated credentials, but they can
impersonate the compromised party in new TLS connections until the
delegated credential expires.</t>
        <t>Thus, delegated credentials should not be used to send a delegation to an untrusted party. Rather, they
are meant to be used between parties that have some trust relationship with each
other.  The secrecy of the delegated credential's private key is thus important, and
access control mechanisms <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> be used to protect it, including file system
controls, physical security, or hardware security modules.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="re-use-of-delegated-credentials-in-multiple-contexts">
        <name>Re-use of Delegated Credentials in Multiple Contexts</name>
        <t>It is not possible to use the same delegated credential for both client and server
authentication because issuing parties compute the corresponding signature using a context string unique to the intended role (client or server).</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="revocation-of-delegated-credentials">
        <name>Revocation of Delegated Credentials</name>
        <t>Delegated credentials do not provide any additional form of early revocation.
Since it is short-lived, the expiry of the delegated credential revokes
the credential.  Revocation of the long-term private key that signs the
delegated credential (from the end-entity certificate) also implicitly revokes
the delegated credential.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="interactions-with-session-resumption">
        <name>Interactions with Session Resumption</name>
        <t>If a peer decides to cache the certificate chain and re-validate it
when resuming a connection, they <bcp14>SHOULD</bcp14> also cache the
associated delegated credential and re-validate it.  Failing to do so
may result in resuming connections for which the delegated credential has expired.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="privacy-considerations">
        <name>Privacy Considerations</name>
        <t>Delegated credentials can be valid for 7 days (by default), and it is much easier for a
service to create delegated credentials than a certificate signed by a CA.<br/>
A service could determine the client
time and clock skew by creating several delegated credentials with
different expiry timestamps and observing which credentials the client accepts.
Since client time can be unique to a particular client, privacy-sensitive
clients who do not trust the service, such as browsers in incognito mode, might
not want to advertise support for delegated credentials, or might limit the number of
probes that a server can perform.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="the-impact-of-signature-forgery-attacks">
        <name>The Impact of Signature Forgery Attacks</name>
        <t>Delegated credentials are only used in (D)TLS 1.3 connections. However, the certificate
that signs a delegated credential may be used in other contexts such as (D)TLS 1.2.
Using a certificate in multiple contexts opens up a potential cross-protocol
attack against delegated credentials in (D)TLS 1.3.</t>
        <t>When (D)TLS 1.2 servers support RSA key exchange, they may be vulnerable to attacks
that allow forging an RSA signature over an arbitrary message <xref target="BLEI"/>.
The TLS 1.2 specification describes a strategy for preventing these attacks
 that requires careful implementation of timing-resistant countermeasures.
(See <xref section="7.4.7.1" sectionFormat="of" target="RFC5246"/>.)</t>
        <t>Experience shows that, in practice, server implementations may fail to fully
stop these attacks due to the complexity of this mitigation <xref target="ROBOT"/>.
For (D)TLS 1.2 servers that support RSA key exchange using a DC-enabled end-entity
certificate, a hypothetical signature forgery attack would allow forging a
signature over a delegated credential.
The forged delegated credential could then be used by the attacker as the equivalent of an
on-path attacker, valid for a maximum of 7 days (if the default
valid_time is used).</t>
        <t>Server operators should therefore minimize the risk of using DC-enabled
end-entity certificates where a signature forgery oracle may be present.
If possible, server operators may choose to use DC-enabled certificates only for signing
credentials and not for serving non-DC (D)TLS traffic.
Furthermore, server operators may use elliptic curve certificates for DC-enabled
traffic, while using RSA certificates without the DelegationUsage certificate
extension for non-DC traffic; this completely prevents such attacks.</t>
        <t>Note that if a signature can be forged over an arbitrary credential, the
attacker can choose any value for the valid_time field.  Repeated signature
forgeries therefore allow the attacker to create multiple delegated
credentials that can cover the entire validity period of the
certificate.  Temporary exposure of the key or a signing oracle may
allow the attacker to impersonate a server for the lifetime of the certificate.</t>
